Seneca Backend Technical Task - Jake Creely

Here is my service for the seneca backend technical task. 

To get it working, you should have mongodb installed and running. Then update the environment variables below:

PORT - define the port the server runs on by default this is 3000 as defined in src/config.ts
MONGODB_URL - url of mongodb instance, it might look something like this mongodb://localhost:27017/stats

To run it, you can use `npm run start`

To run the tests, you can use `npm run test`

Assumptions:
Only added test cases for the responses in the API schema which were all if it was successful. The routes should handle errors but no test cases to confirm at the moment.
